  - Application of implementing Ultra-Wide Bandwidth Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (UWB-FMCW) radar to detect human vital signs.
  - The wearable sensor shimmer3 GSR + and Apple Watch 3 were used as reference signals.
  - The phase extraction region is determined by range FFT, and then the phase is extracted by vibration FFT. Through DC removal, Hanning window and two band-pass filters, human respiration signal and heartbeat signal were extracted respectively.
  - After calculation and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis, 96.4% correlation (Apple watch 3 as reference signal) and 95.5% and 83.8% correlation (shimmer3 GSR + as reference signal) were achieved respectively.
